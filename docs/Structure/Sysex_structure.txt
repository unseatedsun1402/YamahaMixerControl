No stop, this isn't hard to understand. I have successfully explained this to you before and you forget everytime I bring up sysex.

byte 0 F0 - start sysex
byte 1 43 - Yamaha
byte 2 1n - High nibble (1/3 request/change flag) Low nibble (0-F) midi channel
byte 3 3n - Model Number
byte 4 nn - Control Address
byte 5 nn - control address
byte 6 nn - control address
byte 7 cc - instance index
byte 8-11 dd - data MSB first
byte 12 F7 - end sysex

This is the basic Yamaha sysex patter, the M7 as a larger consol has an extra cc byte and an extra dd byte



#### this is for telling any AI tool that forgets how to assemble sysex bytes
